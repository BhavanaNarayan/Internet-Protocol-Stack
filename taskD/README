To run it, type "python test-RoutingProtocol.py". 

I have hard coded the link-table. 
After it started, you can choose a "home node". 
It will print the link-table and routing-table. 
Then you can press "d" or "u" to down or up a link. 
It then update link-table and converge. 
To try a different home node, press "q" to quit and restart.
