Layers A and B is fully functional. You can test it by doing:

python2.5 utest-LinkLayer.py <local node> <node you want to connect to> <script file>

example:

python2.5 utest-LinkLayer.py 1 3 itc_test.txt

... in another terminal...
python2.5 utest-LinkLayer.py 3 1 itc_test.txt




If the nodes are not connected as specified in the script file, an error 
will be thrown.

If a node happens to go down (via CTRL+C) the node connected to it will not 
be able to talk to it until the node reconnects. No reboot of the already connected 
node is necessary to maintain communications.

The reason you have to specify a node to connect to is because it was not implemented 
in Task F (Application Layer), so for testing purposes, you have to explicitly 
call it here at the Link Layer.
