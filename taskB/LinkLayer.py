  on localhost). After that, we iterate through all the links where each element of 
  this 'links' variable is a tuple consisting of (nid, hostname, flag). The flag 
  determines if the link is up or down. If our nid matches an nid in the 'links' 
  list variable, then we return the host name. This is necessary for resolving the
