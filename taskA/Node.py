class Node(object):
  """
  This class defines our node structures, which are end-systems, within the network.
  The class members are as follow:
  
    [1] _nid = integer
      This is a unique number starting with 1.
      
    [2] _host_name = string
      This is the name of the machine. For example, u-02.ecc.unr.edu
      
    [3] _udp_port = integer
      This is used for all communications to/from the node.
      
    [4] _links = list of tuples (integer, boolean).
      This contains a list of the links this node is has links for. The flag 
      is necessary to determine the link's status (up or down). Note that this list 
      is not static in that more nodes can link to this node. With this, nodes are 
      implicitly linked together.
      
    [5] _mtu = integer (casted to byte)
      This is a link's maximum transmission unit in bytes. Apparently, each node will 
      have the same MTU for all of its links. When connected to another node, we will 
      have to consider the different MTUs from both ends. In this case, we would take the 
      smallest MTU.
    [6] _shutdown = boolean
      If true, then that means the node is exiting cleanly.
